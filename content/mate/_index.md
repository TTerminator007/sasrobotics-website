## Marine Advanced Technology Education

The SAS Robotics team competes in MATE's Ranger class.

In MATE, we spend months building an underwater ROV (Remote Controlled Vehicle) to perform various tasks outlined competition manual for the year. These tasks range from easy tasks such as moving objects to their designated locations to very difficult tasks, such as identify drawings and objects with image recognition or have a seperate micro ROV to send into a small space for a visual check.

Every year, we send two of our best teams to the ASEAN MATE regional in Surabaya to compete for the opportunity to go to the MATE worlds competition.
