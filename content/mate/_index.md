## Marine Advanced Technology Education

In MATE, we spend months building an underwater ROV (Remote Controlled Vehicle) to perform various tasks outlined competition manual for the year.

We complete in MATE's Ranger class.

Every year, we send two of our best teams to the ASEAN MATE regional in Surabaya to compete for the opportunity to go to the MATE worlds competition.
