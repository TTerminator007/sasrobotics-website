## About Us

#### If you would like to get in contact with us, feel free to email our mentors [Meredith White](mailto:mwhite@sas.edu.sg) and [Barton Millar](mailto:bmillar@sas.edu.sg).

We are the robotics program at Singapore American School. 

Every year, up to 50 students take on the daunting task of building a competition ready robot to compete in the Vex, MATE, and FRC Competitions.

Many pour their heart and soul into making these robots, often giving up time afterschool or during breaks to work on designing, building, coding, and perfecting their robots.
